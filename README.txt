search.networkchuck.coffee is pretty much a SearXNG engine, so don't worry.
SearXNG is a search engine, which is even safer than DuckDuckGo.
Recently (I'm pretty sure it was recently, as of 09.07.2022), DuckDuckGo has been exposed for being affiliated with a tracking company (still, I'm pretty sure).
SearXNG is (most likely) the best alternative to DuckDuckGo.
It does search from Google, DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Bing etc.
You might ask "But they all track you! How's that the best alternative?'
Well, SearXNG uses a private random profile with nothing in it. Meaning if you search for something, it'll actually be the first search, atleast that's what they'll all think.
So, that's why I chose SearXNG.
The browser was made with help of Programming Hero on YouTube.

--IMPORTANT--
Make sure to always type https:// or http:// at the start of the url, or else it won't work.
I've tried making it work, but for some reason, when I press enter, it crashes the browser.
